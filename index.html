      <p class="image-text-top">Jaguar E-Type
      </p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The 1960s Jaguar E-Type is a classic sports car that was once described by Enzo Ferrari as "the most beautiful car ever made." McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty, recommends it as a must-drive car, stating that it outperforms many other cars from its era, with a top speed of up to 150 m.p.h. and superior braking capabilities. The Jaguar Heritage Driving Experience program in Kenilworth, U.K. offers fans of classic cars the opportunity to drive the marque's classics for a day, making it a popular destination for enthusiasts.</p>

      <p class="image-text-top">Chevrolet Corvette</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The Chevy Corvette, a symbol of the Big Three muscle cars, is the most popular collected vehicle in America. According to Keith Martin, publisher of Sports Car Market, the second generation of the Corvette, produced from 1963 to 1967, is "the most iconic American car ever made." Even today, its design remains fresh and breathtaking, cementing its status as a classic American car.</p>

      <img src="Miura.jpeg" alt="Vintage Car 3">
      <p class="image-text-top">Lamborghini Miura</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The Miura, which debuted in 1966 as a mid-engine speedster designed to compete with Ferrari, is considered by many to be the sexiest car ever built. McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty, claims that piloting the Miura is a life experience that transcends mere driving. He also asserts that the sound of its six carburetors feeding a thirsty V-12 engine, located right behind the driver's head, is an experience like no other. Furthermore, the Miura is considered one of the most beautiful cars ever produced. To purchase one, contact the Lamborghini Club America or an auction house like RM Sotheby's or Gooding & Co., who are typically more knowledgeable about these cars before they reach the general market.</p>

        Porsche 911</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The Porsche 911 is an exemplary vintage sports car, especially during the golden era before its redesign in 1974. McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty, believes that the early 911 represents vintage driving at its best, as it provides one of the most authentic driving experiences of any sports car ever built. Despite being an older model, first-generation 911s still have plenty of horsepower and can perform well on the track even by today's standards. Mint condition models can be found on eBay.</p>

      <img src="Drophead.jpeg" alt="Vintage Car 5">
      <p class="image-text-top">Rolls-Royce Dawn Drophead</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The original Silver Dawn drophead, launched in 1949 and retired in 1954, was based on the first full-size car made by Rolls-Royce after the war. The name was intended to signify the dawn of a new era for both the world and Rolls-Royce's place in it. Slightly smaller than pre-war cars, the Dawn allowed the British bespoke carmaker to reintroduce motoring craftsmanship while embracing the modern age. These vehicles are incredibly rare, with only three of the original 28 dropheads remaining in the U.S., all of which are owned by private collectors. Fortunately, after a 60-year hiatus, Rolls-Royce is introducing a successor model to the Silver Dawn.</p>

      <p class="image-text-bottom">The Mercedes SL 300 Gullwing was a groundbreaking car of its time, and it remains a sought-after classic today. With its direct fuel injection and impressive top speed, it set a new standard for sports cars. While many of the surviving SL 300s are still owned by their original owners, some can be found in automotive museums and at classic car events. The Mercedes-Benz Classic Center in Irvine, CA is also a great place to see these iconic vehicles up close.</p>

      <p class="image-text-top">Ferrari 250 GTO</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The Ferrari 250 GTO is one of the most valuable and sought-after cars in the world, with only 39 ever made. While it may be out of reach for most collectors, any vintage Ferrari with a V12 engine from the 1960s is sure to be a coveted classic. These cars represent the pinnacle of Italian sports car design and engineering, and they continue to inspire enthusiasts and collectors around the world.</p>

      <p class="image-text-top">Aston Martin DB4</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The Aston Martin DB4 is a classic sports car and a precursor to James Bond's iconic DB5. According to Hagerty, the DB4 is a "thoroughbred" that can handle long drives with ease. Due to their rarity, it may be difficult to find one to drive, but befriending a collector could increase your chances.</p>

      <p class="image-text-top">Volvo P1800</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">The Volvo P1800 is a two-seater sports car that was made famous by its appearance in the TV series The Saint, where it was driven by actor Roger Moore. It is also known for its durability, with one surviving model having covered over three million miles. While most models are owned by private collectors, it is still possible to find one for sale through Volvo Owners Clubs or by making an offer to an owner.</p>

      <img src="NSX.jpeg" alt="Vintage Car 10">
      <p class="image-text-top">Acura NSX</p>
      <p class="image-text-bottom">There's no need to go to an auction to get your hands on a first-generation Acura NSX, as the carmaker produced 9,000 of them. Hagerty calls it the most underrated car on the list, as it combines supercar specs with daily-driver manners. The car inspires confidence and begs the driver to push it harder, making it a joy to drive. The new Acura NSX, set to be released in 2019, is expected to spark renewed interest in the original.</p>
